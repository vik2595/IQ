If you want to try to run Jenkins on localhost, the other way around is that, install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download which expose localhost urls over internet. After installation of the ngrok run it e.g

./ngrok http 8080
It will give you a url like this: http://3b2db437.ngrok.io

Now under payloadUrl: type the url as:

http://3b2db437.ngrok.io:8080/github-webhook/
Now the localhost Jenkins setup would run and the payload error would be gone.

Note: In above URL, you mentioned 8080 again. Since the url generated on ngrok already contains this, adding it again would result in service timeout error : "We couldn’t deliver this payload: Service Timeout".

To avoid this, you want to edit your webhook as (removing :8080) " http://3b2db437.ngrok.io/github-webhook/

This solved the problem.

Also a tip for end users: I forgot to add a trailing forward slash after github-webhook/, which caused issues for me. I saw others also doing the same mistake and found answers on StackOverflow. Maybe something to be careful about.
