Go to EC2 and create another slave
Stop any runni9ng instances

Choose AMI -> Seelct Linux Version-> Assign Public Ip enable-> storage (8 GB)-> Add Tags (Name, Jenkinsslave1) -> Conf Sec Group-> WebServerSG-> (SSH, TCP, 22, Anywhere) , (Custom TCP, TCP, 8090, Anywhere) -> Reviwe and Launch-> use the same key here as well-> choose exisiting key.

From limits tab check the current limit on instances
Limits will be setup by Amazon

Connect to Webserver using SSH link
From Gitbash connect

by default ec2-user

sudo su -

Java on AWS:
java -version will give you the java version
sudo yum list| grep java-1.8
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y
update-alternatives --config java -> selection number -> 2 to point to correct java version

sudo su -
create user from root
useradd jenkinsslave1

sudo su jenkinsslave1
need to create ssh key to connect two systems
Public key and private key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f /home/jenkinsslave1/.ssh/id_rsa

ls -lat
go to .ssh
cd .ssh
ls -alt

id_rsa
id_rsa.pub

cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
chmod 700 authorized_keys


login to Server now
open git bash
connect to server
sudo su -

ls -alt
cd .ssh
mkdir /var/lib/jenkins
ls -alt
go to root
mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh


Scan the keys from slave to server

note jenkins slave Private ip using SSH keyscan

ssh-keyscan -H 172.31.29.124 (Priv IP) >>/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts

ls
cat known_hosts

chown jenkins:jenkins known_hosts
chmod 700 known_hosts
cat known_hosts

Now from Jenkins UI-> from Manage Jenkins-> Manage Nodes-> Add new Node -> Slave01-> no exec 5-> pwd -> /home/jenkinsslave1-> label as N1 -> launch method only build jobs with-> via ssh-> slave private ip-> select kind as SSH-> 
user name jenkinsslave1-> get the key from slave machine using CD .ssh from cat id_rsa and copy the whole file and paste it-> more id_rsa-> add and select this cred from start to end into notepad-> click on relaunch.


from jenkins
configure
restric where this can run
select N1.
ls workspace
cd workspace
job1.
