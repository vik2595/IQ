Automate the instances availbility on demand using auto scaling

First create Load balancer

choose ALB

Name: ACLB
HTTP 80
Availabilty: Select All
Conf Sec : seelct existing SG from previous LB.
config Routing:
Target Group: New Target Group
NAME: ACLDEV
Targettyope: instances
http, 80, http, /, trafficport, 2, 2, 3, 30, 200
Register targets, Review and create.

Launch Configuration Tab:

launch config
Auto scaling groups
Create auto scaling geoup
create or select launch config
create auto scaling group

Select get started -< Seelct AMI-> t2.micro-> create launch conf-> name: myLC -> User data: 
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
echo "Welcome to Devops" > /var/www/html/index.html
chkconfig httpd on
add storage
conf sec group: 
SSh-> TCP->22->Anywhere
HTTP-> TCP-> 80-> customip-> seelct sg of created load balancer
Review
choose an existing pair
create launch conf


Conf Auto scalaing fgroup

ASG
MYLC
2 instances
network - select vpc
subnet - add all the req availbility zones

Advance details:
Load balancing : Receive traffic from one or more 

Target Groups: ACLDEV
Health Check Type: ELB
Health Check Grace period: 300
config scaling policies
seelct use scaling policies to adjust the capacity
seelct between 2 and 6


Increasae group size and decrese group size
Add 1 instances when 60 

decrease the when its 10 percent
Review
Add notif
conf tags
review
Create auto scaling groups.


Go back to instances now

its creating 2 instances based on the conf we did
go to auto scaling group
instances
try to terminate one here
and the other will open again


VPC:
====
We alwasy take automatic

But real companies create their own VPC's.

Seelct VPC under services:


Got your vpc's

AWS->VPC-> AZ1, AZ2-> Subnet_> 

Create VPC-> MY VPC, 10.10.0.0/16, default-> create

Create Internet Gateways -> by default we have one by amazon.
if you want you can create one as below
Create my inernet gateway -> seelct go to action and attach gateway to My VPC.


Now subnet need to be created:

Create subnet-> name, public subnet1, choose my vpc, az, useast 1a or canada, 10.10.1.0/24 and create.

now create sample instance myweb using the above options:


Go to your vpcs-> seelct my vpc-> from actions-> edit dns host name, enable check box. Now public Ip will be displayed fro this isnstance.

Now go to create Route table:


Create route table-> myroute-> my vpc and create.

go to routes and add routes using edit routes

0.0.0.0/0  through internet gateway created (IGw-x)earlier and save


Now subnet2 need to be created:

Create subnet-> name, public subnet2, choose vpc, , useast 1b , 10.10.1.0/24 and create.


Now go to create another Route table:


Create route table-> myroute1-> my vpc and create.

go to routes and add routes using edit routes

0.0.0.0/0  through internet gateway created (IGw-x)earlier and save


now create instance with all these private options
